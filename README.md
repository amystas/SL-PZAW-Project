# How to complete your to-dos?
1. Go to **Projects->Tasks** and see if there are any assigned to you
2. Find your task in **Issues**, open it and click **Development->Create new branch**. You can delete the number from the branch name
3. Start your work on that branch, move the task to **In Progress** column
    * Try to create commits for every stage of your work, do not commit complete code all at once
    * Choose a good commit name, it's appreciated to leave a description too
      
      ‚ùé "done", "commit 1", "error fixed"
      
      ‚úÖ "completed importing data from DB" (descprition recommended), "first subtask: updated tailwind.config.js, added chosen colors", "minor fix: Attribute [student] does not exist (typo)"
5. Once you're done, create a pull request, assign it to another collaborator
6. **DESCRIBE YOUR WORK** - this step is required for EVERY task
7. Move the task to **Awaits Merge** column
8. Once another collaborator reviews your work, they'll move the task to **Done** column
