# Welcome to our Silly Little Project!
### Meet the team:

@amystas - that's me ofc 💅🏻✨✨

@teflonn - acts silly ☺️😝

### What are we going to do?

We don't know yet, we're gonna slay tho 💅🏻💅🏻

### Jk, here's the plan

Basically, teflonn likes cars (i like only Cadillacs, but nvm), so we're making our silly little car wiki. 

We're gonna use laravel and tailwind (VS Code, PhpStorm). 

#### Who's gonna do the job?
Teflonn writes the articles and is in charge of the styles (tailwind) 🤓

I do everything else 😇😇
